# SwitchOut unofficial implementation

This code is an adaptation of the original one available at the end of the official paper: **SwitchOut: an Efficient Data Augmentation Algorithm for Neural Machine Translation\***

I just made few tweaks to make it work with:  
- python 3.9.13
- numpy==1.22.4
- torch==1.11.0
